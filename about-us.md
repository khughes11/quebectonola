## Where Did This Come From?

I found a book called [Oakville and the Sixteen](https://utppublishing.com/doi/book/10.3138/9781487579050) in my local used book store. It is filled with many interesting facts and stories about the history of a small town near where I live in Southern Ontario, previously called Upper Canada. I am not quite sure why, but one story in particular really caught my imagination. It is the story of the original road through Oakville. The road wasn’t created by settlers, instead it was an ancient indigenous trail, one which the author claims connected Quebec with New Orleans and which other sources suggest is many thousands of years old. In modern times much of the trail is lost to the sands of time, which I find quite tragic. What did the trail look like; would I recognize it? How many people walked the trail, through forests of monstrous trees and endless wildlife as they lived their lives? What were they thinking as they walked on those journeys? What were their hopes and fears and loves?

This site is about uncovering some of the sand and building a connection with our past and heritage. 

Many indigenous trails throughout North America are lost to history, they have been bulldozed and replaced with our modern built enviroment. We cannot undue the destruction, but maybe we can create a digital memory of these once so important pathways?

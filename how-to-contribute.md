# How to Contribute to Quebec to NOLA

This blog is a collaborative project dedicated to mapping North America's indigenous trails, with at least the initial focus being on a trail which ran through the eastern GTA and connected Quebec with New Orleans. 

If you have content about North America's indigenous trails you would like to contribute, please do. Collaboration is managed through github, create a pull request and we will review and merge it in!  

Reposity for the site is here [https://github.com/khughes11/quebectonola](https://github.com/khughes11/quebectonola).

Please no AI generated content.

I appreciate there is a learning curve associated with github; if you would like to contribute but don't want to use github please feel free to email me your content or questions to: 

Thank you for contributing to the Quebec to NOLA project.
